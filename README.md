##  Enigma Self-Assessment

# Functionality (3)

  - Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods implemented and functional

  - Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces implemented and functional

# Object Oriented Programming (3)

  - Project includes a module, albeit very basic, that can be used outside the project

  - One class uses class methods

  - All methods are 8 lines of code or less, only 2 exceed 7 lines

  - No class exceeds 100 lines

  - Variable names and methods clearly communicate purpose

  - All that being said, there's definitely a self-diagnosed case of class-phobia going on here

# Test Driven Development(4)

  - SimpleCov shows 100% test coverage

  - Enigma test implements mocks and stubs

  - All test names clearly communicate the purpose of the test

# Version Control(4)

  - 20+ pull requests with detailed comments

  - 100 commits excluding merges, each documenting a single piece of functionality
